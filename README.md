# Minecraft2Real
This is a course project of Deep Learning, lectured by Yi Wu.

We implemented an effective method for complex scene image translation between Minecraft world and real world. More details can be found in the `report.pdf`.

The idea is directly from [cycle-diffusion](https://github.com/ChenWu98/cycle-diffusion). It correctly translates objects with the same semantic meaning in two worlds.

We compares other methods on image translation:
- [DDIB](https://github.com/suxuann/ddib)
- [CUT](https://github.com/taesungp/contrastive-unpaired-translation)
- [CycleGAN](https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix)
